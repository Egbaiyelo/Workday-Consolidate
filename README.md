# MyWorkConsole


Browser extension* to provide a 'jobSeeker-side' dashboard for the job seeking process.
It helps manage applications across workday clients, collecting data on status, etc.
It also helps login and sign up with the same email so the user doesn need to manage them


Portals like myWordayJobs don't provide a proper frontend
- You have to register/login for each company
- Your data isn't stored across platforms so you enter them everytime.
- You can't track all your jobs at once
- Form filling is tedious with the redundancies and the datalists that need to load your responses.

This project strives to fix this. It provides an extension and a native host application to provide a unified interface for jobseekers to breeze through these roadblocks.

## Key-features
The workconsole would allow
- Easy registration/ login or automatic authentication
- A dashboard for all job statuses
- Form fill helpers

To install the extension download the extension folder
- Open the browser extensions environment and click developer mode
- CLick load unpacked and select the extension in your file explorer.

To install the app, you need to set it up yourself as it does not yet have an installer.
You can see the instructions on the [app's readme page](./app/README.md)

Upon installation, the app and extension would ensure the conenction and you can use the application. You can use the extension alone but would lose the dashboard it provides.
